            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p> The goal of this project is to build a browser-based game using JavaScript classes, Node.js, and Express, while practicing modular code design and client-server interaction. 
                The game will consist of several parts: a class file, with at least one exported class containing three properties and methods; a game logic file that uses imported classes, object arrays, destructuring, and array methods; 
                a server file built with Express that includes GET/POST routes and serves static files; and client files that send/receive JSON via API calls and update the UI.
